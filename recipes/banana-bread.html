        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Banana bread at its best. Lots of bananas and a hint of almond and almond liqueur make a delicious 
            banana bread--I love it served with butter.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>5 very ripe bananas, mashed</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a loaf pan with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix bananas, brown sugar, butter, eggs, almond extract, and amaretto together in a separate 
                bowl. Add flour mixture; mix just until flour is incorporated, about 1 minute. Transfer mixture 
                to the prepared loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. 
                Let cool before serving, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
